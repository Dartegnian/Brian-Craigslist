My classmate has this web programming class and they were tasked to create a redesign of an existing site. They were assigned to Craigslist and my classmate then contacted me to make a design and the site itself. This is a "minimal" site so keep your expectations low. I made this in under 8 hours using the base website template I made when we were at F.E.U. Tech.
