This is the project we made for the "<a href="https://2017.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/ideate-and-create/dictionary-earth/details" target="_blank">Dictionary of Earth</a>" category of the NASA Space Apps Challenge. This is a working prototype, though, so some features may be incomplete or be very buggy (but hey, *at the very least*, it's actually a **working** prototype and not a PowerPoint concept). The development status of this project is currently **CANCELLED OR DELAYED** as the developers are currently busy with other things.

## Usage
In your database manager (preferably phpMyAdmin), create a database named `nasa`. Once you're done, you can import our SQL database `MMC-database.zip` into the `nasa` database. Once you have completed these steps, you are now able to access the dictionary feature of our app. The files herein are supposed to be hosted locally, which means that links point to **http://localhost/SPACEAPPS**, so we recommend downloading the `Website` folder and renaming it to `SPACEAPPS` in order to maintain compatibility. Again, please take note that this project is a working prototype, so understand that there **will** be bugs/incomplete features in this app.
